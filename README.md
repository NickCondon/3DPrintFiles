# IMB Microscopy 3D Print Files
The following items have been designed and printed by IMB Microscopy staff for a variety of our microscopes and users' needs.

##Design
Where possible plates are designed to work with universal stage inserts suitable for 96-well plates, however due to the nature of the differeing spring clamp mechanisms different 
vendors use, it is difficult to have a single size approach. Where suitable we have named the files after the manufacturer we are using them in.

We have trialed a number of different printable mechanisms to secure slides and chamber slides over the years from springs, clamps and clips. After user testing we have decided 
to use a single bar that runs across the width of the plate, secured with 2 small M4 screws and washers.

##3D Printer
We currently use an Ultimaker 3 printer with either [Ultimaker PLA](https://ultimaker.com/materials/pla) or [ColorFab_HT](https://colorfabb.com/filaments/co-polyesters-filaments/colorfabb-ht?gclid=CjwKCAjw3_KIBhA2EiwAaAAliv2hO8IAnwysIvs3wGxmizfM4LmUZmBdy4J3z07-9MBqc1pi12IJQRoCfAAQAvD_BwE)
